Data compression is the process of reducing the size of a data file such that it uses less space than the original file and can be transferred easily. The file is encoded using encoding information that uses fewer bits than the original representation. There are many data compression algorithms which aim to compress data of different format.
	There are different algorithms even for a single data format that uses different approach to compress the data. In all of data compression algorithms, we first need to study and analyze the characteristics of the data in order to deduce some patterns that can help us to compress the data into a smaller size and compact representation. The main aim of the compression techniques is to reduce the size of the data file by removing redundancy in stored data, thus increasing data density and making it easier to transfer data files. In this paper, we will study about different image compression techniques and text compression techniques used in real world. The methods such as Huffman coding, Arithmetic coding and LZW coding are considered.
